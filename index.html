Welcome to ChromeTest! This privacy policy explains how we handle your data while using our Chromebook testing application. We prioritize your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how we collect, use, and protect your information.

Information We Collect

Device Information: We may collect basic system information about your Chromebook (such as CPU, memory, storage, and network status) to generate diagnostic reports. This information helps provide accurate test results.

How We Use Your Data
Diagnostic Testing: The keystroke data and system information we collect are used exclusively for running diagnostics and verifying the functionality of your Chromebook's hardware components.
Local Processing Only: All data collected by ChromeTest is processed locally on your device. We do not store, transmit, or share this data with any third-party services.
What We Don't Do
No User Data Collection: ChromeTest does not collect, transmit, or store any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive user data.
No Remote Logging: We do not remotely log keystrokes or track your activity outside of the testing functions within the app.
No Data Sharing: We do not share or sell any data collected by ChromeTest to third parties.
User Consent
By using ChromeTest, you agree to the collection of keystroke data strictly for testing and diagnostic purposes. We will always respect your privacy and only gather data necessary for improving your Chromebook's performance and functionality.

Security
We take the security of your information seriously. Since all data is processed locally on your device, there is minimal risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
